Oranges's Math Library (omath) is a comprehensive, open-source library aimed at providing efficient, reliable, and versatile mathematical functions and algorithms. Developed primarily in C++, this library is designed to cater to a wide range of mathematical operations essential in scientific computing, engineering, and academic research.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó® Features
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance, ensuring quick computations using AVX2.
- **Versatility**: Includes a wide array of mathematical functions and algorithms.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified interface for convenient integration into various projects.
- **Projectile Prediction**: Projectile prediction engine with O(N) algo complexity, that can power you projectile aim-bot.
- **3D Projection**: No need to find view-projection matrix anymore you can make your own projection pipeline.
- **Collision Detection**: Production ready code to handle collision detection by using simple interfaces.
- **No Additional Dependencies**: No additional dependencies need to use OMath except unit test execution
- **Ready for meta-programming**: Omath use templates for common types like Vectors, Matrixes etc, to handle all types!

## ‚è¨ Installation
Please read our [installation guide](https://github.com/orange-cpp/omath/blob/main/INSTALL.md). If this link doesn't work check out INSTALL.md file.

## ‚ùî Usage
Simple world to screen function
```c++
TEST(UnitTestProjection, IsPointOnScreen)
{
    const omath::projection::Camera camera({0.f, 0.f, 0.f}, {0, 0.f, 0.f} , {1920.f, 1080.f}, 110.f, 0.1f, 500.f);

    const auto proj = camera.WorldToScreen({100, 0, 15});
    EXPECT_TRUE(proj.has_value());
}
```
